<!--
        MINI EXERCISE: Make a PB&J Recipe.

        >>> Don't worry with the ingredient list just yet
        >>> Place each recipe instruction inside a respective element (perhaps use <p> for each)
        >>> Create a CSS class (here and in box-model: try not to inline your CSS props if not necessary) and give it a background color
        >>> Use height/width defined in the above CSS class in order to format those elements

        >>> CONSIDER: In what ways can you use height/width to ensure your content is all visible?
